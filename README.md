## ✅ WHY THIS WILL NOW WORK

✔ Each task has its **own Mermaid block**  
✔ Each `graph TD` is isolated  
✔ Proper closing ``` after Task 1  
✔ New ```mermaid for Task 2  
✔ GitHub-compatible syntax

## 🧪 FINAL CHECK (IMPORTANT)

In VS Code:
1. Open `ARCHITECTURE.md`
2. Right-click → **Open Preview**
3. You should see **2 separate diagrams**

If VS Code preview works → GitHub preview **will also work**.

### 🎉 You are done. This is the correct final version.

If you want, I can now:
- Review your **DATASET_ANALYSIS.md**
- Prepare **interview explanation notes**
- Verify **entire repo before submission**

Just tell me 👍
